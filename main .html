                <a href="#">Read More</a>
                <p id="para">Daksum is a favorite picnic spot in this region and rightly termed as Walker's paradise due
                    to its excellent trekking locations.
                    This serene locale is situated at an altitude of 2438m above the sea level at the distance of 40 km
                    away from main Anantnag city.
                    t is located at an altitude of 2,438m above the sea level.Coordinates: 33°36'43"N 75°26'6"E. It is
                    42 km from the district headquarters
                    Anantnag and about 100 km from summer capital Srinagar, on the trekking route to Kishtwar. On the
                    way to Daksum there is Botanical garden
                    and spring called Kokernag one can enjoy. .One can reach Daksum by arriving vailoo, which is the
                    base camp and from there one can board a
                    cab.From there the trail leads to Sinthan Pass and Sinthan top.A walk in Daksum will take you up to
                    the hills enveloped in lush coniferous
                    trees and past gurgling brooks. The simple music coming out of the flute of an unseen shepherd
                    tending to his flock will keep you
                    mesmerized The landscape of Daksum is quite unique. From the tree-covered hills, you will suddenly
                    find yourself in grassy meadows
                    serving as host to the sheep coming for pasture. The invigorating mountain air, the calm and
                    serenity, the densely clad hills, all
                    make the trip to Daksum a memorable experience. Then, there are the snow-capped mountains in the
                    background that further enhance
                    the beauty of this place. The trek to the gorgeous Sinthan top meanders its trail through some
                    pristine and virgin meadows and
                    valleys. You will be crossing dashing Bringi River many times with every crossing opening to a new
                    and better treasure of natural
                    beauty.</p>
